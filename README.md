## Genki Kanji

[_Genki Kanji_][1] is a free resource to quickly search through the Kanji taught in the Genki 1 textbook.

This web app is mainly geared towards students and instructors. I thought of it since I had trouble remembering which kanji I was expected to know when doing my textbook homework.

I also thought that teachers can use this when making lesson materials to quickly check if students are expected to know certain kanji's in each chapter.

Try it here! [Genki Kanji][1]

# Features I Plan to Implement

1. Add missing kanji from Genki 2 (maybe when I finish studying Genki 1 myself)
2. Dark mode
3. Accessibility adjustments (high contrast ?)
4. Some kind of lazy image loading to decrease load on server
5. Create download links to clean modern powerpoint slides of kanji strokes for each lesson
