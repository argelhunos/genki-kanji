## Genki Kanji

[_Genki Kanji_][1] is a free resource to quickly search through the Kanji taught in the Genki 1 textbook.

This web app is mainly geared towards students and instructors. I thought of it since I had trouble remembering which kanji I was expected to know when doing my textbook homework.

I also thought that teachers can use this when making lesson materials to quickly check if students are expected to know certain kanji's in each chapter.

Try it here! [Genki Kanji][1]
